# pizzeria-raffaele

Pizzeria Raffaele is a personal project where main purpose was to design and build from scratch a simple and responsive web application which could simulate a page of some actual restaurant. My main concearn was to create responsive menus (both navigation and restaurant) in order to practice media queries usage.

## Built with:
HTML i CSS (flex-box, grid, media queries)<br/>
JavaScript<br/>
AJAX (XMLHttpRequest)<br/>
Google fonts<br/>
Font awesome<br/>

## Functionality:
The most significant content on the page is pizza menu divided into rolled categories. There are subpages with information required to place an order loaded with XMLHttpRequest. Subpages can be switched thanks to navigation menu which is rolled or static depending on viewport width.
