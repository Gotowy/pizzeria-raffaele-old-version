# pizzeria-raffaele

Pizzeria Raffaele is my first personal project where main purpose was to design and build from scratch a simple and responsive web application with Vanilla JavaScript which could simulate a page of some actual restaurant. My main concearn was to create responsive menus (both navigation and restaurant) in order to practice media queries usage.

## Built with:

HTML i CSS (flex-box, grid, media queries)<br/>
JavaScript<br/>
AJAX<br/>
Google fonts<br/>
Font awesome<br/>

## Functionality:

The most significant content on the page is pizza menu divided into rolled categories. There are subpages with information required to place an order loaded with AJAX. Subpages can be switched thanks to navigation menu which is rolled or static depending on viewport width.

## Status:
The project was recognized as completed some time ago but I want to refactor it a bit in the near future. I used XMLHttpRequest because I wanted to test out the API but I perceive it a suboptimal solution so I will probably change it into JSON or another technology which would enable to load page content dynamically without any major JS framework or library.
