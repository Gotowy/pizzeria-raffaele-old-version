# pizzeria-raffaele

Pizzeria Raffaele is a personal project which served testing my abilities to design and build from scratch a simple and responsive web application which could simulate an actual site of a restaurant. My main concearn was creating responsive menus (both navigation and restaurant) in order to practice using media queries.

## Built with:
HTML i CSS (flex-box, grid, media queries)
JavaScript
AJAX (XMLHttpRequest)
Google fonts
Font awesome

## Functionality:
The most significant content on the page is pizza menu divided into rolled categories. There are subpages with information required to place an order loaded with XMLHttpRequest. Subpages can be switched thanks to navigation menu which is rolled or static depending on viewport width.
